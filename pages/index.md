# Welcome

I built my **Writing Samples** document library using Jekyll hosted on GitHub (gh-pages) and markdown for writing the content. I created it as a recent challenge to learn authoring tools like Jekyll. Plus, I wanted a way to show my writing samples in a format other than a README.md file on GitHub. 

You'll find various writing samples, from blog articles to getting started guides all the way down to UX microcopy and UI strings. I continue to challenge myself and add more examples when I can, so check back often.  

If you're interested in starting a conversation with me, [pencil in 15 minutes](https://calendly.com/pattishort/15min) to chat. I'm always looking for a new problem to solve. 

~ Thank you.
